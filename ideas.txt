either attack a large area each time and run away little bit or attack a medium area and run away a lot
user the direction flag (STD/CLD)

if we attack at B3 then we should just really quickly attack the a3 at the same line

attack with the opcode movsb and not movsw, but be ready to be overwrite with the opcode movsw
so when we attack - we will override others with movsb (and they will be ready for movsw and not movsw)
but when others attack us, we will be ready for both movsw and movsb
Energy:
use the virtual register Energy and call to the opcode WAIT*2 (but in run time this takes only 1 turn)
the energy is get lower by 1 each 5 rounds
the formula is: 1 + (int)(log(energy) / log(2))
that means that if energy is odd, is not helping us (so energy(2) and energy(3) are the same)

note: zombies who their name ends with 'h' are running at double speed

general sizes:
    /** Warrior's private stack size */
    private final static short STACK_SIZE = 2*1024;
    /** Group-shared private memory size */
    private final static short GROUP_SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE = 1024;
    /** Maximum number of warriors in a fight */
    private final static int MAX_WARRIORS = 20;
    /** Maximum attempts to load a warrior to the Arena */
    private final static int MAX_LOADING_TRIES = 100;
    /** Minimum initial space (in bytes) between loaded warriors */
    private final static int MIN_GAP = 1024;
warrior size:
MAX_WARRIOR_SIZE = 512
MAX_SIZE = 128
the code:
if (warriorSize > MAX_WARRIOR_SIZE) {
    warriorSize = MAX_WARRIOR_SIZE;
}

so because of that, maybe its an idea to make the warrior bigger then 512, 
and then the code will just cut the end of the code (but this is not important because the end of the code is not running anyway)

Maybe save the int 0x86 (big bomb) to the safer warrior,
and then he will check if he's been attack. If so, he will use the int 0x86 to defend himself


put the attack size in the shared memory, what will allowed the warriors to change the attack size of each other

write a specific bit before and after the call far (so that nobody would be able to do int 0x87 to us)
and change this bit with the second player

put inside the copy more movsw so that the rep movsw's content wont be overwritten later


change once in a while the lower byte (from 0x50 distance to 0x40|0x10) so that we wont stay in a specific LSB for too long


For Tuesday:
* attack down or up
* put gap between the attack areas
* divide the warriors to attacker and defender
* use WAIT opcode
* when to use 0x86/0x87 - only on top 10
* should we attack the zombies
* what should be the attack size/gap/run away ('./attack_spaces_calc.txt')


T-shirts:
army of cookies dressed with military uniforms 
* with green beret
* holding the symbol of the Intelligence Corps

To ask yuda:
* are T-shirts relevant



make a version of the code where we attack down instead of up
and then test this version live and choose which version is better (down / up)
Note: instead of writing each time a new version of the code just write the changes that need to be done in order to switch


put some code in the end of the stack/shared memory and than when the code is over it will skip to the start of the code
