; this code is a list of calculations for testing what is the best 'variables' to put

; definitions:
; 'attack' = direct attack in a certain place (until you run use 0xA5 to move/run away to another location)
; 'attack size' = the amount of data that been attacked in an <attack>
; 'fight zone' = the whole place to attack (0x100 * 0x100 = 0x10_000)
; 'jmp distance' = what is the size of the jmp opcode
; 'blank' ('gap') = how much space do you leave blank (<jmp distance> - the sub that has been done to sp)
; 'variables' = how much to jump after each <attack>, how much to attack each <attack>

; calculations:
; attack size: 
; jmp distance: % sub word [bx], 0x200 % = 0x200


attack size | blank | moves to complete the whole fight zone
